# This is a janky hack to build the site because the code highlighter I wanted to use was broken
# 1. Run `jekyll build` to compile the site on the dev branch
# 2. Add and commit all changes to dev
# 3. Git checkout the changes to _site into master with `git checkout dev _site`
# 4. Git checkout this script to master with `git checkout dev build_site`
# 5. Run `./build_site`
# 6. Remove `build_site` script
# 7. Commit and push master

mv _site ..
rm -rf *
mv ../_site/* .
rmdir ../_site
