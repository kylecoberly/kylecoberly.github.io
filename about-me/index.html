<section class="about-me">
    <h2>Let&rsquo;s Make The Web!</h2>
    <p>I&rsquo;m here to create, enjoy life, and empower others to do the same.</p>
    <p>I currently serve as the Faculty Director for <a href="https://www.galvanize.com" target="_BLANK">Galvanize&rsquo;s</a> software education programs in Denver. Previously, I was a skunkworks developer for <a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/" target="_BLANK">Pearson Education</a>, Director of Instruction for <a href="http://mymusicskool.com/" target="_BLANK">My Music Skool</a>, and a regional marketing manager for a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/1116702/" target="_BLANK">musical instruments marketing firm</a>.</p>
    <p>Outside of work, I co-host the <a href="https://www.sprintuxpodcast.com/" target="_BLANK">Sprint UX Podcast</a>, and I have organized the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Ember-js-Denver/" target="_BLANK">Denver Ember meetup</a> since 2015. I&rsquo;m also an adminstrator for <a href="https://denverdevs.org/" target="_BLANK">Denver Devs</a>, one of the largest community Slack groups in the world.</p>
    <p>I hold a <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/emp/programs/graduate-degree/master-engineering-management" target="_BLANK">Master of Engineering in Engineering Management degree</a> from the University of Colorado, a <a href="https://msudenver.edu/cis/" target="_BLANK">Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Systems degree</a> from the Metropolitan State University of Denver, as well as degrees from the <a href="https://www.artinstitutes.edu/seattle" target="_BLANK">Art Institue of Seattle</a>, and <a href="https://www.bellevuecollege.edu/" target="_BLANK">Bellevue College</a>. Additionally, I&rsquo;m a StrongLoop Certified Node Developer, a Certified Database Specialist, and Certified Master Information Systems Analyst.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m particularly wonky about management &amp; leadership, relational data modeling, agile, and vim. I was once (accurately) described as &ldquo;that Linux user no one gives a shit about.&rdquo; I love the Broncos, stand-up comedy, and ska music.</p>

    <h3>Some things I believe</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>People learn <em>concrete-to-abstract</em>, not <em>abstract-to-concrete</em></li>
        <li>Content delivery and teaching are not the same thing</li>
        <li>Work can and should be meaningful and fun</li>
        <li>You can teach someone a skill, but you can&rsquo;t teach them to care</li>
        <li>Tired people do bad work</li>
        <li>Agility is a way of life</li>
        <li>Plans give people a false sense of security</li>
        <li>Design is an engineering task, not an artistic one</li>
    </ul>
