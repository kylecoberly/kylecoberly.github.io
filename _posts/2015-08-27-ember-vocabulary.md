Based on the wonderful suggestion of [@pixelhandler](https://twitter.com/pixelhandler), I made an ember glossary. Check out [embervocab.com](http://www.embervocab.com), and submit an issue on the [Github page](https://github.com/kylecoberly/ember-vocab) if I missed anything!

You can also check out the original [slide deck](http://slides.com/kylecoberly/deck-6) from my presentation at Ember.js Denver, August 2015.
