## "Mobile First"

I have a confession- I _hate_ the term "mobile first," and I'm not entirely sure why. It may be because when the term first came into vogue, it basically meant "Make the shitty version of your site first, and then add stuff until you get the real site your actual users use," a technique commonly known as progressive enhancement. Considering that many phones are more powerful than the common desktops of the "mobile first" era, it hits my ears the same as "Can you do HTML5?" or "Can you make it parallax?"

That said, what I _do_ like about designing a mobile view first is that it forces you to prioritize things. With few exceptions, mobile layouts are a top-down, force-ranked prioritization of your content. *Progressive enhancment forces you to consciously add elements, instead of whittling your precious pile of shit down to the things that actually matter.* I like this approach, and I also like that it dodges any "Yeah I know it sucks on phones, but the mobile version is coming soon" apologies.

(The truth is that your mobile users and your desktop users often have different priorities, and both deserve a well-thought out experience)
